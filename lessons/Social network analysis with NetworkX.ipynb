    "\n",
    "Graphviz has one job and does it well: given a set of nodes and edges and given some attributes that say how they should look, it makes the best possible visual picture, or layout, of the graph. What Graphviz doesn't support is any sort of mathematical operation or analysis on the graph, beyond counting the nodes and edges - you can't say whether there is a loop, or whether there are unconnected nodes, or which nodes are the most connected, or how many distinct groups there are. For this we need other tools, and a popular one is NetworkX. You can find the documentation about NetworkX at [this link](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.10/overview.html)."
